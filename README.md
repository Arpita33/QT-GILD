# QT-GILD
#### QT-GILD (version 1.0)
This repository contains the official implementation of ***QT-GILD*** <!--code and helper scripts of--> <!-- our paper [**"wQFM: Highly Accurate Genome-scale Species Tree Estimation from Weighted Quartets"**](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/bioinformatics/btab428/6292084) accepted in ***Bioinformatics, 2021***. -->

<!-- ## Notice to all the users
- Codebase has been slightly updated **(on June 12, 2021)** to fix some precision related bugs.
- New version (i.e. the current stable version **v-1.3**) has it fixed. Please use the current version if you have used the jar file/codebase before the aforementioned date.
- New version also includes quartet score outputs (please see below **"To infer quartet scores"** section).

## Short Description

**QT-GILD** is a quartet imputation technique for estimating species trees despite the presence of missing data. 

QT-GILD an  automated  andspecially tailored unsupervised deep learning technique, accompanied by cues from natural languageprocessing (NLP), which learns the quartet distribution in a given set of incomplete gene trees andgenerates a complete set of quartets accordingly.

<!--wQFM uses a two-step technique in which we first use the input set of estimated gene trees to produce a set of weighted four-taxon trees (*weighted quartets*).-->
